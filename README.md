This project aims to detect cyberbullying in text using ML Classification Algorithms. 
A training and predicting pipeline is implemented to contrast performance of various popular classification algorithms and determine the best suited model.
#Data 
most cases people has detected cyberbullying by mapping sentiments against the text but it clearly doesnot define either it was cyber bullyed 
or not.but here in my dataset i have further catogrized mine text to  identity hate,insult,obsence,severe toxic and threat, 
later detected cyber bullying by running  the sentiment on it.
#Algorithm

but i have omit the bag classifier, random forest classifier and decision tree as they were taking longer to repond despite of waiting for hours
